Fix npm release.

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v2.0.0) (2016-05-15)

This release mainly improves the component‚Äôs API (thus some breaking changes) and add some new props.

Code has been split in multiple components and tests have been rewritten with [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme). It should be easier to add and test the upcoming new features!

Thanks everyone for the support and for the help on making this component better ü§ó
If you have issues or suggestions, don't forget the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gpbl/react-day-picker)!

**Breaking changes**

* The `onDay*` event handlers receive as third argument an object of modifiers instead of an array.

 This mean that if you where writing:

 ```js
 onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {
   if (modifiers.indexOf('selected') > -1) {
     console.log('This day is selected')
   }
 }
 ```

 you must now write:

 ```js
 onDayClick(e, day, modifiers) {
   if (modifiers.selected === true) {
     console.log('This day is selected')
   }
 }
 ```

 or better:

 ```js
 onDayClick(e, day, { selected }) {
   if (selected) {
     console.log('This day is selected')
   }
 }
 ```

* Removed `onDayTouchTap`. Use `onDayClick` instead. If you need more granularity over touch events, you can use the new `onDayTouchStart` and `onDayTouchEnd` props. See [#153](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/153) for more details.

* Fixed import with CommonJS modules ([#136](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/136)).

 This affects code using `require('react-day-picker').default` or similar syntax, which was required for v1.3.0. Now you can `require('react-day-picker')` as usual, i.e. without specifying `default`. If you are using ES2015 modules `import DayPicker from 'react-day-picker'`, this change shouldn't affect you.

* New `formatDay` function in [LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/LocaleUtils.html).

 If you are using your [custom LocaleUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/LocalizationCustom.html) to localize the calendar, you need to implement this function as well, which is required to format the newly added [aria-label attribute](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) (see the [documentation](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/LocalizationCustom.html) for an example). If you are localizing [using moment](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/LocalizationMoment.html), this change shouldn't affect you.


**New props**

* New [`disabledDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#disabledays-prop) and [`selectedDays`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#disabledays-prop) props. They receive a function `(day) => Bool` as value to easily define which day should have the `selected` or `disabled` modifiers. See [#34](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/34) for more details.

  So if you were writing something like:

  ```js
  <DayPicker
    modifiers={
      { selected: day => isDaySelected(day) },
      { disabled: day => isDayDisabled(day) }
    }
  />
  ```

  now you can write:

  ```js
  <DayPicker
    selectedDays={ day => isDaySelected(day) }
    disabledDays={ day => isDayDisabled(day) }
  />
  ```

* Added [`reverseMonths`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#reversemonths-prop) prop to render the most recent month first. ([#147](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/141) by [sonrtomas](sonrtomas))
* Added [`onDayKeyDown`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#ondaykeydown-prop), [`onDayTouchStart`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#ondaytouchstart-prop), [`onDayTouchEnd`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#ondaytouchend-prop) props.

**Improvements**

* Navigate between weeks or years using left/right or up/down arrow keys ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))
* Added various `aria-*` attributes ([#132](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/pull/132) by [limscoder](https://github.com/limscoder))

**Bug fixes**

* Navigation with keyboard when using `fromMonth` or `endMonth`

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/tree/v1.2.0) (2015-12-04)

**New features**

* Use a custom caption element with the new [`captionElement`](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/APIProps.html#captionelement-element) prop. A custom caption element is useful, for example, to create a year/month navigation as shown in [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples?yearNavigation). Read [#52](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/52) for a discussion about this feature.

**Improvements**

* Improved navigation when clicking on outside days ([#112](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/112), see also [this example](http://react-day-picker.js.org/examples?restricted))
* New `addMonths` function in [DateUtils](http://react-day-picker.js.org/docs/DateUtils.html)
* Added a style definition to package.json ([#105](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/105), thanks @webbushka)

**Fixed bugs**

* Make the component working again with React ~0.13 ([#108](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/108))
* Fix a bug when clicking on outside days when `fromMonth` or `toMonth` were set ([#97](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/97))
* Replace a wrong `attr` tag with the right `abbr` in the weekdays row ‚Äì https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/issues/33#issuecomment-159751186. ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the component may now use the CSS defined for `abbr` tags.

* Class names have been updated (objects are now CamelCase). As example, please see [the updated CSS file](https://github.com/gpbl/react-day-picker/blob/master/site/src/style/DayPicker.scss).
*  [#27] All rendered tags are now `div` or `span`. Use CSS to style the daypicker as table.
* A `today` modifier is added automatically
* Event handlers receive the event as first argument. For example: `onDayClick(e, day, modifiers)` instead of `onDayClick(day, modifiers, e)`
* `onNextMonthClick` and `onNextMonthClick` props have been removed. Use `onMonthChange` instead.
