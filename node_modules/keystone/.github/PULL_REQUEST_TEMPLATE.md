 Notes:
 * For more information on the End-2-End (E2E) testing framework for Keystone 4, see:
    https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone-nightwatch-e2e
 * To successfully have all E2E tests pass you need to have the following set up:
    - A recent version of Chrome or Firefox
    - Java Runtime Environment 1.8+
 * If you are developing in Windows you may run into linebreak linting issues.
   One possible workaround is to remove the "linebreak-style" rule in `node_modules/eslint-config-keystone/eslintrc.json`.
