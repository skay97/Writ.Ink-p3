# Writ.Ink

# The Problem: there isnt a platform for people to post poems, essays, and short-stories 

# The Solution: Writ.Ink will provide a platform for writers to get discovered and will be a place that will focus and encourge text content. Unlike Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms that you can technically write text post. These post are often burried under picture and video heavy content. 

# Users will be able to subscribe to authors and recieve notifications and see new content in their feed.

# Technologies (may change): ReactJS, KeystoneJS, QuillJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, Express, Animate.css, Twilio
