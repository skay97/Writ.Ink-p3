Running locally you need 3 terminals open: one for client, one for server, and another one for MongoDB back-end. Below are the steps:

1. Install Node.js;
2. Install MongoDB;
3. `git clone https://github.com/haichao-yu/react-redux-blog.git`;
4. Go to directory `client`, and run `npm install`;
5. Go to directory `server`, and run `npm install`;
6. In one terminal, run `mongod`;
7. In `server` directory, run `npm run dev`;
8. In `client` directory, run `npm run start`;
